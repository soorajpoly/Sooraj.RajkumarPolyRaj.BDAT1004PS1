If the process is successful, no one but the intended recipient can understand the encrypted message.

The first step of cryptanalysis is often to build up a table of letter frequencies in the encrypted text. Assume that the string letters is already defined as 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. Write a function called frequencies() that takes a string as its only parameter, and returns a list of integers, showing the number of times each character appears in the text.
